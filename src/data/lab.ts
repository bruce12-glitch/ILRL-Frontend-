      "Mitigating long-context quadratic prefill latency with entropy-guided sparse attention",
    status: "Active",
    blurb:
      "Prefill cost grows quadratically with prompt length, so a 256K-token context can spend most of its time-to-first-token doing attention work that a token never uses. EntroPrefill measures per-token attention entropy on the fly and prunes provably low-information key ranges before they reach the attention kernel — rebuilding a causal mask that keeps the computation near-linear in context length.",
    detail:
      "The system ships as a drop-in prefill path: an entropy scorer fused into the sampling loop, a hardware-aware block-sparse kernel, and a calibration pass that bounds perplexity drift. It composes with paged KV managers and requires no changes to model weights, so existing checkpoints keep their quality while long prompts stop paying quadratic rent.",

    status: "Active",
    blurb:
      "Decode throughput in modern serving stacks is bounded less by compute than by KV-cache residency — the memory wall. Page-EntroKV manages the cache as entropy-tiered pages: hot pages stay in FP16 on HBM, warm pages drop to FP8, and cold pages quantize to 2-bit and migrate off-device, entirely under an SLO-aware eviction policy.",
    detail:
      "Because importance is estimated from attention entropy rather than recency heuristics, pages that look old but matter stay resident, and pages that look recent but contribute nothing are cheaply recomputable. The paged layout plugs into vLLM-style block tables, so admissions, preemption and tier migration are scheduler-visible operations rather than offline tricks.",

    status: "Active",
    blurb:
      "Serving is a loop: requests arrive, batch, decode a step, and re-enter the scheduler — thousands of times per second. RecLoop treats that recurrence as the object to optimize, closing the loop between the scheduler and the kernels it dispatches with admission control, preemption and speculative loops driven by predicted recurrence cost.",
    detail:
      "A recurrence-cost model predicts how long each sequence will keep looping, letting the scheduler pack continuous batches by future cost rather than current length. Paired with EntroPrefill's sparse prefill and Page-EntroKV's tiered cache, the runtime meets P99 deadlines with far less capacity — the lab's thesis is that inference always happens in a loop, and systems should be designed around that recurrence.",
